# Biome Color Grabber
A quick and dirty script that get the grass and foliage colors for a biome. It uses the grass/foliage colormaps, as well as the biome's temperature and downfall for the calculations.

If you want to fix anything up, feel free to make a commit or PR. I wrote this to integrate into another script, so the input is kinda awkward for general use. Add or suggest features if you want.


The colormaps are included in the repo. I got them from the [MC wiki](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Color#Biome_colors).


Thanks to `seehowtheyroll` from the MC Configs Discord server for kickstarting the research on this.
